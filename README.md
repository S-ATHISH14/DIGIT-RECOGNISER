A handwritten digit recognizer is a computer program or system that is designed to identify and classify handwritten digits. It uses machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, SVM, or KNN, to analyze and recognize the patterns in the handwritten digits. The recognizer takes an input image containing a handwritten digit, processes it through the trained model, and outputs the recognized digit along with its confidence score. These systems are commonly used in tasks like digitizing handwritten documents, recognizing zip codes on mail, and processing checks.
